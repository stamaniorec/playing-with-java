Playing with Java
====================

This repo is to serve as backup for a bunch of code, mostly from 2014.

Interesting things include:
- data structure problems - mostly trees
- algorithmic problems
- a simple chat server
- a simple echo server
- moving rectangles and scrolling backgrounds
- playing with more popular design patterns like singleton, strategy, observer, etc.
- a problem distributor for students
- toy programs for trying things out
